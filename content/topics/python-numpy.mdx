# NumPy (Numerical Python)

NumPy provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It is the engine under the hood of almost all AI libraries.

## 1. Arrays vs Lists

NumPy arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr.shape) # (5,)
```

## 2. Array Operations

Operations are "vectorized" - they happen to the whole array at once without loops.

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)  # [5, 7, 9]
print(a * 2)  # [2, 4, 6]
```

## 3. Multi-dimensional Arrays (Matrices)

Crucial for representing images (Height x Width x Channels) or batches of data.

```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
print(matrix.shape) # (2, 2)
```

## 4. Indexing and Slicing

```python
data = np.random.rand(5, 5) # 5x5 random matrix

# Get row 0
print(data[0, :])

# Get column 1
print(data[:, 1])
```

## 5. Broadcasting

Arithmetic between arrays of different shapes.

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) # 2x3
b = np.array([1, 0, 1])              # 1x3

# b is added to each row of a
print(a + b)
```

## 6. Key Functions for AI

- `np.dot()`: Matrix multiplication
- `np.argmax()`: Finding the class with highest probability
- `np.reshape()`: Changing dimensions (e.g., flattening an image)
- `np.mean()`, `np.std()`: Normalization statistics
