# LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain to allow for cycles in your chains, enabling agent-like behaviors.

## Core Concepts

- **State**: The central object that is passed around.
- **Nodes**: Functions that modify the state.
- **Edges**: Control flow between nodes.

## Example

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[str], operator.add]

def agent(state):
    # Agent logic here
    return {"messages": ["Agent message"]}

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("agent", agent)
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")
workflow.add_edge("agent", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```
