# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

## 1. Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
The model learns from labeled data.
- **Regression**: Predicting a continuous value (e.g., House prices).
- **Classification**: Predicting a category (e.g., Spam or Not Spam).

### Unsupervised Learning
The model learns from unlabeled data.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points (e.g., Customer segmentation).
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features (e.g., PCA).

### Reinforcement Learning
The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## 2. Key Terminology

- **Feature**: An input variable used for making predictions (e.g., square footage).
- **Label (Target)**: The output variable to predict (e.g., house price).
- **Training Set**: The dataset used to train the model.
- **Test Set**: The dataset used to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well (including noise) and fails to generalize.
- **Underfitting**: When a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

## 3. The ML Workflow

1.  **Problem Definition**: What are we trying to predict?
2.  **Data Collection**: Gathering raw data.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting data (handled by Pandas/NumPy).
4.  **Model Selection**: Choosing an algorithm (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Net).
5.  **Training**: optimizing the model parameters.
6.  **Evaluation**: Measuring performance metrics (Accuracy, MSE).
7.  **Deployment**: Serving the model (e.g., via FastAPI).

## 4. Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**: Fits a line to data.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-like model of decisions.
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees.
- **Neural Networks**: Inspired by the human brain, used for complex tasks (images, text).

In the next sections, we will explore how to serve these models using frameworks like FastAPI and Streamlit.
