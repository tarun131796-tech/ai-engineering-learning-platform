# Python Data Structures

Data structures are how you organize inputs and outputs in AI models.

## 1. Lists

Ordered, mutable collections. Used for batches of data, layers in a model, etc.

```python
# A list of loss values
losses = [0.9, 0.85, 0.72, 0.65]

# Accessing
print(losses[0])   # 0.9
print(losses[-1])  # 0.65 (Last element)

# Slicing
print(losses[1:3]) # [0.85, 0.72]

# Appending
losses.append(0.60)
```

## 2. Dictionaries

Key-value pairs. Essential for configurations, JSON data, and model state dicts.

```python
config = {
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "architecture": "CNN",
    "dropout": 0.5
}

print(config["learning_rate"])

# Iterating
for key, value in config.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## 3. Tuples

Immutable lists. Used for returning multiple values or ensuring data hasn't changed.

```python
image_shape = (224, 224, 3)

# image_shape[0] = 100  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

## 4. Sets

Unordered collections of unique elements. Great for finding unique labels or tokens.

```python
tokens = ["AI", "ML", "AI", "Data", "ML"]
unique_tokens = set(tokens)
print(unique_tokens) # {'AI', 'Data', 'ML'}
```

## 5. List Comprehensions

A concise way to create lists. Very common in data preprocessing.

```python
# Square every number
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [x**2 for x in nums]

# Filtering
evens = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
```
