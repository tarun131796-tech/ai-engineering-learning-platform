## Getting Started

```python
import chromadb

# Setup Chroma
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create a collection
collection = client.create_collection("my_collection")

# Add documents
collection.add(
    documents=["This is a document", "This is another document"],
    metadatas=[{"source": "my_source"}, {"source": "my_source"}],
    ids=["id1", "id2"]
)

# Query
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["This is a query document"],
    n_results=2
)
```
