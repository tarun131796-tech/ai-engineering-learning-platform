## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

LangChain makes it easy to connect language models to other sources of data and allow them to interact with their environment.

## Why It Matters

LangChain addresses several key challenges in LLM application development:

1. **Context Management**: Handles the limitations of token windows
2. **Tool Integration**: Connects LLMs with external data sources and APIs
3. **State Management**: Maintains conversation state across interactions
4. **Prompt Engineering**: Provides templates and utilities for effective prompting

## Mental Model

Think of LangChain as a **pipeline builder** for LLM applications:
