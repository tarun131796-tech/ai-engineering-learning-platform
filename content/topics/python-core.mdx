# Python Core Concepts

To build AI systems, you need a rock-solid understanding of Python's syntax and flow control.

## 1. Variables and Types

Python is dynamically typed, but understanding types is crucial for data processing.

```python
# Variables
learning_rate = 0.01        # float
batch_size = 32             # int
model_name = "ResNet50"     # str
is_training = True          # bool

# Type Checking
print(type(learning_rate))  # <class 'float'>
```

## 2. Control Flow

### If-Else Statements
```python
loss = 0.5

if loss < 0.1:
    print("Converged")
elif loss < 0.5:
    print("Improving")
else:
    print("Keep training")
```

### Loops
AI often involves iterating over datasets.

```python
epochs = 5
for epoch in range(epochs):
    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs}")

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 1000:
    count += 1
```

## 3. Exception Handling

Robust AI pipelines need to handle errors gracefully (e.g., missing files, GPU out of memory).

```python
try:
    # Simulating a risky operation
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    print("Cleanup operations")
```

## 4. Type Hinting (Modern Python)

In AI engineering, we use type hints to make code readable and catch bugs.

```python
def train(epochs: int, lr: float) -> float:
    # Training logic...
    return 0.95  # accuracy

final_acc: float = train(10, 0.001)
```

This makes your code self-documenting, which is vital when working with complex neural network architectures.
