# Vector Databases

Vector databases are a new type of database designed to store and search vector embeddings. They are the memory for AI.

## What are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) that capture semantic meaning.

## How Vector Databases Work

Unlike traditional databases that match on exact values, vector databases match on similarity. They use distance metrics like Cosine Similarity or Euclidean Distance to find the most similar vectors.

## Use Cases

- **Semantic Search**: Search by meaning rather than keywords.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Recommend similar items.
- **Q&A Systems**: Retrieve relevant context for LLMs.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Find outliers in data.
